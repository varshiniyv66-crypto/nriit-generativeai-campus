# 🎨 White Gold & Diamond Flagship Theme
## Design Philosophy
This theme represents the pinnacle of luxury web design, interpreting "Gold & Diamond" as **Clarity, Precision, and Brilliance**.

### 1. The Palette: "Crystalline Luxury"
Instead of a dark cave, we present a **Diamond Prism**.
- **Background**: `Ice White` (#F8FAFC) enriched with a `Sky Blue` (#0EA5E9) top-down glow, simulating light refraction through a diamond.
- **Glass**: Frosted White Glass (`glass-premium`) creates a physical sense of depth, floating above the content.
- **Gold**: Used sparingly for prestige — Borders, Gradient Text, and Key Badges.

### 2. User Interface "Expertism"
- **Visibility**: High-contrast Dark Slate text ensuring maximum readability against the light background.
- **Interaction**: Vibrant **Sky Blue** hover states that feel responsive and electric.
- **Depth**: Multi-layered shadows (Ambient + Direct) give every card a tactile, "lifted" feel.

### 3. Application Strategy
- **Global CSS**: Defines the core physics of light, shadow, and color.
- **Public Pages**: Airy, open layouts with diamond-cut hero sections.
- **Dashboards**: Professional, clean interfaces that reduce eye strain while maintaining premium branding.
