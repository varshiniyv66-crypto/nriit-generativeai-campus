Debating is carried out in debating chambers and assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by voting. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leader\u00c6s debates, are sometimes held in democracies.

      "content": "Engineering mathematics is the art of applying maths to complex real-world problems; combining mathematical theory, practical engineering and scientific computing to address today\u00c6s technological challenges.\nTechnical skills\nAll Engineering Mathematics degrees are built on five key themes which cover theoretical and practical aspects of the application of mathematics. They run throughout the programmer, developing technical skills in each area as you progress, reaching the frontiers of current research in the fourth year of our MEng degrees\nMathematical modelling\nThe flagship theme of the Engineering Mathematics degree. You'll apply all the skills from the rest of the programme to solve real world problems, working individually or in groups. The case study problems are up-to-the-minute, span a huge range of discipline areas, and are derived from current research, industry and business.\nMathematics\nCore mathematics is an inherent part of our degree programmes, and the type of mathematics you'll study is incredibly varied. First year mathematics units bridge the gap between school and university mathematics. By your final year, many units are motivated by our research interests and will take you to the frontiers of the subject. You'll learn a unique blend of continuous and discrete mathematics, enabling you to understand the underlying structure of an extraordinarily wide range of applications.\nScientific computing\nComputing is crucial for applying mathematics in the real-world. Unlike in text books, many problems at the cutting edge of science and engineering do not result in equations with nice analytical solutions. So you'll use computers to find approximate numerical solutions. We'll teach you the programming skills needed to complement your other technical skills.\nEngineering\nYou'll gain an excellent background in general engineering so that you can really engage with practical problems, as well as learning the language of engineering. You'll have the chance to experience courses across the Faculty, including dynamics and control, thermodynamics, fluids, space systems, cryptography and sustainability.\nData science and machine learning\nBeing able to analyse big data is nowadays a fundamental skill. We will provide you with strong statistical foundations and specialistic knowledge of the most effective machine learning techniques to address the challenges of data analysis across scales and applications.\nVISION\n\u00f2 We envision our students as excellent engineers, not only in the field of science and technology, but also in good citizenship and discipline.\n\u00f2 Our commitment lies in producing comprehensive knowledge seekers and humane individuals, capable of building a strong and developed nation.\nMISSION\n\u00f2 To achieve the vision we should have diligent faculty who use effective teaching methodologies.

In order to effectively create exams and quizzes, it is important to establish and understand the learning objectives that are being measured.\nA quiz is a form of game or mind sport, in which the players (as individuals or in teams) attempt to answer questions correctly. It is a game to test your knowledge about a certain subject. In some countries, a quiz is also a brief assessment used in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, and/or skills.\nQuizzes are usually scored in points and many quizzes are designed to determine a winner from a group of participants \u00fb usually the participant with the highest score. They may also involve eliminating those who get too many questions wrong, the winner being the last man standing. Quizzes may be held on a variety of subjects (general knowledge or 'pot luck' (which could be anything)) or subject-specific. The format of the quiz can also vary. Popularly known competition quizzes include \u00f2 Pub quizzes \u00f2 Quiz bowl In an educational context, a quiz is usually a form of a student assessment, but often has fewer questions of lesser difficulty and requires less time for completion than a test.\nSummary Report Debate:\nDebate is a process that involves formal discussion on a particular topic. In a debate, opposing arguments are put forward to argue for opposing viewpoints. Debate occurs in public meetings, academic institutions, and legislative assemblies. It is a formal type of discussion, often with a moderator and an audience, in addition to the debate participants.\nLogical consistency, factual accuracy and some degree of emotional appeal to the audience are elements in debating, where one side often prevails over the other party by presenting a superior \"context\" or framework of the issue. In a formal debating contest, there are rules for participants to discuss and decide on differences, within a framework defining how they will do it. Debating is carried out in debating chambers and assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by voting. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leader\u00c6s debates, are sometimes held in democracies. Debating is also carried out for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies.\nPLACEMENTS\nCONTACT\nPHYSICS\nABOUT\nCHEMISTRY\nABOUT\n",
