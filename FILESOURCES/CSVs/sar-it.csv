""
"Evaluation Criteria:"
"? Continuous Assessment:"
""
"• Daily Reviews: The project guide conducts daily reviews to assess the progress of the group and the interaction among students. This helps in obtaining a qualitative measure of group and individual performance."
"• Literature Survey and Presentation: Weightage is given to the literature surveyand presentations, evaluated both at the batch level and for individual contributions."
""
"Quantitative Measures:"
"Attendance: Regular attendance is considered in the evaluation"
""
"Group Evaluation: Group performance is assessed to gauge collective effort and outcomes"
""
"Student Evaluation Form:"
"At every review session and at the end of the project, each student is required to fill out an evaluation form The form includes ratings for all group members, including themselves, based on the following criteria:"
""
"2. Overall Contribution: Rank each batch member’s overall contribution to the project"
"3. Time and Effort: Assess the amount of time and effort each member contributed to the project 3.Willingness to Collaborate: Evaluate each member’s willingness to work with other group members"
"4.Exceptional Contributions: Determine if any member provided exceptional input to the project 5.Completion of Assigned Tasks: Rate how well each member completed their assigned part of the project"
""

"Process for selecting the Best Projects:"
""
"1. Establish specific criteria like creativity & innovation, technical complexity, execution, research, and presentation to ensure a fair assessment."
"2. Carefully score each project against the criteria to gauge quality and impact."

"their work, challenges faced, and the outcomes achieved. Feedback from the industry supervisor, who assesses the student’s performance and professionalism during the internship, is also considered. The evaluation is conducted by a committee comprising an internal faculty supervisor, who"

"• Internal Marks: These include marks from midterm exams (descriptive, quizzes, and assignments), laboratory assessments (day-to-day performance, internal marks, and records), seminars, and projects."
"• External Marks: These are derived from end-semester examinations."
""
"For each course, 4 to 6 survey questions are designed to gather student feedback in a course-end survey, which constitutes the Indirect Attainment."
""
"The weightage of each Course Outcome (CO) is calculated based on the marks obtained in descriptive exams, one-third of the online quiz marks, and one-third of the assignment marks."
""
"Direct Attainment Calculation: A target value is set for internal and end-semester examination attainment. The internal examination target is 70%, while the end-semester examination target is 40%.

"3. Attainment of Program Outcomes and Program Specific Outcomes (50)"
"1. Describe assessment tools and processes used for measuring the attainment of each of the Program Outcomes and Program Specific Outcomes (10)"
""
"The attainment of Program Outcomes (PO) is assessed through two key components: Direct Attainment and Indirect Attainment."
""
"1. Direct Attainment: This involves calculating the attainment based on the marks students achieve in all courses, providing a quantitative measure of their academic performance."
"2. Indirect Attainment: This is assessed by gathering feedback from stakeholders, such as students, alumni, and employers, regarding the effectiveness of the program outcomes, as illustrated in Fig.3.3.1."

"Direct Attainment:"
"The direct attainment of Program Outcomes (PO) is determined by aggregating the attainment levels of all courses using the following assessment process:"
""
"1. Course-PO Mapping: Course-PO mapping tables, as shown in Table 3.1.3, are collected from the respective course coordinators for all courses."
"2. Course Attainment Values: Course attainment values, as detailed in Table 3.2.1, are gathered from the respective course coordinators."
"3. Calculation of Course-PO Attainment: The Course-PO attainment is calculated using the formula:"
""
"course-PO attainment=(course to PO mapping)*(course attainment)"

"•   Interactive Learning Tools: Use of Google Classrooms, Google Forms for quizzes, and online discussions."
"•   Technology-Enhanced Pedagogy: Use of LCD projectors, NPTEL videos, simulation tools, and classroom technology for interactive teaching."
"•   Open Book Tests to improve critical and analytical skills."
"•   Seminars & Presentations: Students present curriculum/advanced topics to build confidence and communication skills."
"•   Industrial Visits to provide practical exposure and bridge industry–academia gap."
"•   Simulation-Based Learning: Adoption of software tools for visualizing theoretical concepts."
"•   Content Beyond Syllabus: Faculty deliver advanced topics to prepare students for higher studies and competitive exams."

"The entire feedback process, including the content of feedback forms and schedules for their distribution and collection, is subject to the approval of the Principal. This oversight ensures that feedback mechanisms align with institutional goals and quality standards."
""
"3. Feedback Collection:"
"Feedback is collected through a dual-mode approach comprising both online and offline platforms. This method facilitates maximum participation from students and other stakeholders, providing flexibility and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the data collected."
""
"4. Faculty members receive standardized feedback evaluated on a 5-point scale."
""
"5. If a faculty member’s overall feedback score is greater than 4.5, their performance is documented as good, and they may be recommended for rewards or recognition."
""
"6. If the score is between 3.5 and 4.5, the faculty member is required to undergo orientation classes to enhance teaching skills and address any weaknesses."
""
"7. If the score is less than or equal to 3, the faculty member may be subject to reassignment or replacement. Additionally, a formal memo will be issued requesting an explanation of their performance."
