Process for Designing the Program Curriculum:

"NRI       Institute    of      Technology       -NRIIT,     is      affiliated   to    Jawaharlal      Nehru         Technological        University,      Kakinada.       The     university     has       framed     the"
curriculum in a methodical way in compliance with AICTE to enrich the learning of the students and make them ready for industry requirements on completion of their degree. JNTUK revises
"the syllabus once in every three years by taking into consideration of the recommendations from various affiliated institutions and in consultation with industry experts, academic experts and all the stake holders."

The JNTUK designs the curriculum by following below steps:

"Step 1: The University collects feedback from the stake holders such as students, affiliated institutions, industrial experts and academicians from reputed institutions."

"Step 2: Once in every three years the university calls for brain storming session and collects the inputs (feedback, suggestions) from stake holders and as per AICTE/UGC guidelines draft the curriculum to meet the"
requirements of the stake holders.

Step 3: The domain experts frames the syllabus and COs.

"Step 4: Following the valuable suggestions of the experts from diverse fields, the final draft is forwarded tor Board of Studies (BoS) for approval."

Step 5: The BoS consists of experts from both academia and industry for approval of the curriculum periodically.

"Step 6: Finally, the university Circulates final draft to its affiliated institutes and can be implemented."

"The following figure illustrates the entire process of designing and developing the university curriculum, which is tailored to meet the needs of the    industry. The syllabus is structured in"
alignment with the following Program Outcomes (POs) and Program-Specific Outcomes (PSOs).

A. Process used to identify the extent of compliance with university curriculum for attaining POs and PSOs (6)

Curriculum gap filling is a vital process in ensuring that an educational program covers all necessary competencies and skills required for students learning outcomes. Approach used to identify and address the
curriculum gaps involves the following steps:

Process Description:

Step-1: Get a curriculum from university with course outcomes for all the program courses.

Step-2: Department invites the Course Instructor (CI) to redefine course outcomes if necessary and to Perform CO-PO mapping and CO-PSO mapping.

Step-3: If the calculated level of CO-PO and CO-PSO mapping is greater than or equal to the target level then follows the university curriculum for the delivery. If not consider those POs and PSOs as gaps.

Step-4: The identified gaps are submitted to the PAC for verification.

Step-5: The DAC proposes various activities to fill the Identified Gaps.

"Step-6: A request for curriculum modifications is communicated to JNTUK through a compliance letter, which concludes the process."

CO-PO-PSO mapping:

• The CO-PO-PSO mapping is a crucial process in academic programs as it ensures that the specific learning outcomes of each course (COs) align with the broader goals of the program (POs) and the discipline-
specific competencies (PSOs).
• This alignment guarantees that students are not only acquiring knowledge and skills at the course level but are also developing the essential competencies required for their overall professional and personal growth.
"• By mapping COs to POs and PSOs, institutions can systematically monitor whether the curriculum is effectively contributing to the desired outcomes."
"• Ultimately, this mapping process enhances the quality of education, ensures accountability, and produces graduates who are well-prepared to meet industry demands and societal needs."
The mapping of the curriculum courses to Program Outcomes (POs) and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) for the R20 Regulation is illustrated below:

"For R-20 regulation, the target value for average CO-PO and CO-PSO mapping is set at 2.4, which corresponds to 80%. In the analysis, a blue color histogram is used to represent the Program Outcomes (POs) and"
"Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) whose average percentage mapping exceeds this 70% threshold, while red color histogram indicates the POs and PSOs that fall below the target value."

"For the POs below the target, the department plans to enhance curriculum delivery with practical exercises, organize workshops and seminars, and implement continuous monitoring"
and feedback. These steps aim to align with the desired POs and improve the overall learning experience.

"In addition to the Institute academic calendar the department also prepares the event wise calendar, gives the schedules of the program, like FDPs, workshops, Guest lectures and seminars etc. to be conducted in the"
department.

"The Head of the department plays a crucial role in organizing the departments work flow. They convene departmentalmeetingstodiscussandfinalizetheworkdistribution among the faculty. During these meetings, the Head of"
"the department is responsible for allocating subjects to each faculty member and ensuring that the timetable is finalized, balancing the needs of the department and the preferences or strengths of the faculty members. This"
process is essential for smooth academic operations and effective course delivery.

Course Delivery Plan:

"•   In our institution, it is standard practice for individual faculty members to prepare a Course Delivery Plan/ Lesson Plan before the start of class work, with guidance from the course coordinator."
"•   This plan is aligned with the Institutes academic calendar and includes the entire course outline, learning objectives for each unit, course outcomes, and CO-PO mapping."
"•   Faculty members employ ICT tools to enhance the effectiveness of content delivery, making learning more attractive for students."
•   The course delivery plan includes the textbooks to be used and various URLs which supports the enhanced learning.
"•   At the end of each unit, the Course Outcome is defined, and a CO-PO Mapping table is prepared.This helps gauge the students understanding of the objectives and outcomes for each unit."

Print                                                                                                                              https://enba.nbaind.org/SARTemplates/eSARUGTierIIPrint.aspx?Appid=10857&Progid=578




"Apart from the listed methods, the students are initiated and motivated to learn from group activities such as group discussion, in-house internships, workshops conducted in the dept. The students are encouraged and"
"supported with learning through MOOC, NPTEL courses. The students are taken to international tech. exhibition in relevant domains for an update of modern tools and technologies. The course material, laboratory manual,"
"question bank, power point presentation prepared by the course co ordinator/instructor is shared with the students as and when necessary."

Continuous Learning Assessment:

"Assessment of students learning is made on a regular basis through internal assessments, assignments, quizzes for theory courses and for practical courses assesment is made on a weekly basis (after the completion of"
every experiment). Learning difficulties of the students are discussed with the Class Teacher/Proctor/HOD or in the faculty meeting and are addressed by improving TLP. Projects and Seminars are assessed based on the
rubrics developed and notified to the students in advance.

C. Methodologies to support weak students and encourage bright students (4)

"Bright Students: Bright Students are the students who can engage in the learning process faster than the rest of learners in classrooms, leading to better grades and greater success in the long run. They are better"
"capable of understanding, retaining, remembering, critical thinking, creativity, and contextualization."

"Weak Students: Weak Students are the students who struggles with academic performance, has difficulty in understanding concepts, lacks effective study skills, or faces external challenges that impact learning."

The department has well defined process to identify different learning capabilities of students and support the students for the overall growth in the academics. We have an efficient counselling system to continuously
monitor the progress of a students and help them in 360 degrees.

The process used to identify and support weak students and encourage bright students is as follows.




"46 of 335                                                                                                                                                                                                                   11/29/2025, 11:57 AM"

D. Quality of Class room Teaching (3)

"• JNTUK usually defines CO’s in the curriculum. The Departmental Academic Committee (DAC) adds the CO’s given by the university in case required. In case the CO’s are not specifically mentioned by the university,"
then the subject experts in consultation with the faculty handling the course define the CO’s.
"• The entire faculty prepare course files with details of the Course Objectives, Course Outcomes, modules, reference material, teaching plan and credits at the beginning of the academic year."
• The classes are conducted as per the prescribed timetable by department program time table with the help of various instructional methods and pedagogical initiatives.
• The faculty is asked to prepare the lecture notes for the allotted course. The suggestions are given to the concerned faculty in order to improve their teaching skills.
"• The department of electronics and communication Engineering ensures comfortable class room ambience with spacious seating arrangements, lighting and ventilation."
• The quality of classroom teaching is well monitored and assessed by the Head of the Department (HoD) from time to time.
"• Regular interactions of the mentors with their students, HoD meetings with all the class incharges, performance of the students in internal tests and assignments will be monitored and assessed by the HoD."
"• The faculty adopts various innovative practices to create and improve instruction methods using pedagogical initiatives such as real examples, collaborative learning for students. These methodologies include"
traditional chalk & talk methods and various ICT Tools.
"• Each classroom is equipped with Board, Notice boards, Boards disseminating POs, PEOs and PSOs."
• The class room ambience ensures the students get more involved in the topic.

E. Conduct of Experiments (3)

Practical knowledge is as important as theoretical knowledge in undergraduate programs. Applying theory through hands-on activities enhances             students technical skills and prepares them for real-world
challenges.

"• The departments labs are well-equipped for smooth experiment conduction. Lab technicians ensure the equipment is in proper condition, while Faculty members conduct the experiments well in advance before the"
semester begins.
"• The university-prescribed list of experiments is displayed in the labs, keeping students informed of the lab syllabus structure."
"• Faculty responsible for lab sessions prepare lab manuals detailing the experiment objectives, model graphs, circuits, waveforms, and expected results."
• Students are grouped into batches of three for lab sessions.
• Faculty demonstrate the experiments before hand and explain the expected outcomes.
• Lab technicians ensure proper handling of equipment by students and assist them in completing tasks.

"• Students are assessed based on designed rubrics, including day-to-day performance, completion of records, and teamwork attitude and behaviour, which aid in student counselling."
"• An annual audit is conducted to assess the working status of lab equipment, with recommendations for servicing or purchasing forwarded by the lab in-charge through the HoD to management. Stock registers are"
updated after equipment procurement.
• CO-PO mapping for lab courses is also conducted by the faculty.

• F.Continuous Assessment in the laboratory (3)

"•   Continuous assessment in the laboratory involves weekly experiments where students are evaluated on equipment handling, adherence to procedures, and understanding of theory."
"•   Marks are awarded based on observations, day-to-day work, and for records."
"•   The process includes regular monitoring, rubrics-based evaluation, and an annual lab audit to ensure equipment readiness."
•   This approach ensures consistent student performance tracking and timely feedback.

G. Student Feedback on teaching learning process and actions taken (6)

Student feedback is an integral part of the Teaching Learning Process. The department collects feedback from students for effective functioning of the teaching and learning process.

(C). Process for monitoring and evaluation (5)

"• To ensure proper conduction of each project, progress of each project is monitored on continuous basis first by the project guide and then by the project review committee (PRC)."
• In the process of monitoring and evaluation during the project period three presentations by each team of the students is made mandatory to monitor and evaluate the progress of the work.
"• The first presentation will be purely synopsis presentation and students are required to show a brief power point presentation describing the main Aim/Objective of the project, the methodology to be used, the time"
"chart, expected results."
• This presentation shall be made before the respective project guide first and on his approval it should be made before the project review committee.
• The project is considered to be approved only if presentation fulfills the requirements.
• If the presentation is not up to the mark either the Committee will ask the students along with their project guide to modify the project and present again or change the project.
• The second presentation of this semester will be planned by the PRC in the eighth week.
• The Third presentation of this semester will be planned by the PRC in the Ninth week.
• This presentation will review the progress of the students. Each group will first show their progress to their respective project guide get the brief project report signed from them and present the same before the PRC.
• The groups are also required to make a power point presentation and present before the PRC.
"• In this presentation the PRC is supposed to mark each student/ group based on their project content, presentation made, project progress, queries answered and attendance out of 40 marks. The PRC shall finalize"
the marks just after the presentation and the record of the same should be circulated to all the concerned project guides.
• 14th week PRC plan for the final presentation (i.e. Final Demonstration) It shall be made on the same way as the previous presentations were conducted and the groups should be evaluated in the presentation will be
"taken by PRC, all project guide should also be present in this presentation."
• The Committee will review the progress of the students. Each group is required to make a project report showing the complete of the project.
• This report should be brief and should mainly contain the detailed methodology/ algorithms adopted/ studied during the entire semester.
• This report should be signed by the project guide and should be submitted before the final presentation.
• The groups are also required to make a power point presentation and present before the final Committee. In this presentation the PRC is supposed to mark each
"student/ group project content, presentation made, project progress, in 16th week internal marks will be allotted for the students based on the evaluations made by the concern project guide and PRC."
• Final External Presentation will be conducted as per the date scheduled by the university. Along with the external examiner Project coordinator will be present in the presentations and the concerned project guide can
be invited at the time his/ her group is making the presentation. The external examiner will evaluate the projects of the students along with the project coordinator in awarding the final marks to each candidate
based on his/her performance.

Evaluation phase of projects are carried in two phases for 200 marks

"•   Each student in the project team is assessed by skill set, concept, understanding and way of presentation."
"•   Each individual and team performance is based on the observations of the project guide, involvement of the student in carrying out the project work, project seminar presentation and the viva voice."
•   Day by Day interaction with the project team members for progress of their project work and observe the individual member performance in their project.
•   Giving suggestions to the project team members to improve their knowledge in their selected domain and giving assignments related to project and to improve their hands on experience.

E. Quality of completed projects/working prototypes (5):

"The projects cover emerging areas such as IoT, VLSI, Embedded Systems, Machine Learning, Signal and Image Processing, and Antenna Design. Students work on projects that address societal needs or involve product-"
"based solutions for real-time applications. Some projects are research-oriented, utilizing modern tools, and their results can be extended to fabrication for communication, radar, and various industrial applications."
Innovative projects are often developed into papers for publication in reputable journals and conferences. Projects which secured highest marks are considered as quality projects.

Process for assessing the quality of Projects:

"A committee consisting of Head of the Department, Professors, Project Coordinators and project guides are responsible to identify the merits and hence decide the best project for the respective years"

"The Project evaluation committee will analyze the nature of the project and make sure that the work is environment friendly, ensures safety, ethics and cost-effective."

"The type of the project selected could be an application, product, a review or a Research work."

Each course was assessed and evaluated with respective course outcomes by using predetermined direct and indirect assessment tools. Direct assessment is carried out by Internal and external assessment and indirect
"assessment is carried out by the course end survey. Schedule of direct assessments is prepared by the course coordinator according to the academic calendar prescribed by the JNTUK, Kakinada."

3.2.1. A List of assessment processes

Direct Assessment:

"Direct assessment of theory courses is carried out by Internal and External assessment of each defined outcome of a course. Internal assessment is done by Assignments, MID Examinations, Quiz Examinations and"
External Assessment by End Examination conducted by the JNTUK. Statements indicating what a student can do after the successful completion of a course. Every Course leads to some Course Outcomes. The CO
statements are defined by considering the course content covered in each module of a course. For every course there may be 5 or 6 COs. The keywords used to define COs are based on Bloom’s Taxonomy.

The assessment process for course outcomes are done in the following ways.

S. No.            Assessment Method                             Description

Two mid examinations are conducted during a
semester.

• Each mid consists of Descriptive exam
"for 15 marks, Quiz for 10 Marks and"
Assignment for 5 Marks.
Mid Examinations (Internal Test)         • Final marks for internal assessment
was carried out as follows:

Final Internal Marks = (Best Mid Marks X 0.8
+other Mid marks X 0.2)



Internal marks and external marks for
practical subjects are 15 and 35 respectively.

• Internal marks are awarded as: Day-to-
"Day work – 5M, Record – 5M and"
Internal Laboratory Test – 5M. Internal
examination marks are evaluated by
Lab Assessment
course coordinator.
• External examination for practical
subject is conducted for 35 marks at
end of the semester by external
"examiner, appointed by the University."



End semester examinations are conducted by
University.

"The external exam is for 70 marks, consists of"
"End Semester Examinations            10 questions, two questions is from one unit"
(Theory)                             and may contain sub questions also.
Students can chose any question from each
unit

Project work is carried out for 200 marks out
of which 60 marks for internal assessment
and 140 marks for external assessment.

• Internal assessment is carried out by
conducting THREE reviews by Project
Project Work                                 Review Committee (PRC).
• External evaluation is done by the
"assessment of project report,"
presentation of project and Viva-voce
conducted by the external examiner
appointed by JNTUK along with Head
of the Department and guide.

50 marks are awarded for seminar by
conducting a presentation in department
Direct                                              level. The seminar presentation is an
Assessment                                            opportunity to improve communication skills of
a student. The student makes a seminar
presentation on a topic of his/her choice.
Seminar                                Seminar is evaluated based on the
presentation by the students before seminar
evaluation committee consisting of Head of
the Department and two faculty members.
Evaluation is taken up from internal
assessment only. Assessment is taken up
from direct and indirect assessments.

Indirect                                            Course Exit Survey is taken for all the courses
Course Exit Survey
Assessment                                            at the end of each semester.



Indirect Assessment:

Indirect assessment of course is carried out by conducting survey on course outcomes from the students at the end of the semester.

3.2.1. B The quality/relevance of assessment process & tools used


Process involved in CO-PO Mapping:
"The role of CO-PO mapping will be assigned to the faculty as per hierarchy followed in below figure. After the course (subject) allotment from the department, the course in-charge of the course has to write appropriate COs"
"for their corresponding course. It should be narrower and measurable statements. By using the action verbs of learning levels, CO’s will be designed. CO statements should describe what the students are expected to know"
"and able to do at the end of each course, which are related to the skills, knowledge and behaviour that students will acquire through the course."

"After writing the CO statements, CO will be mapped with PO of the department. If the department is having more than one section in a year or the same course is available for more than one program of the same institute in"
"a semester, the subject expert will be nominated as course coordinator of the corresponding course. The role of the course coordinator is to review the CO statements and the CO-PO mapping which has been done by"
course in-charge. The year wise coordinator has to consolidate the CO’s of the respective year and maintain the documentation of the CO attainment level of the respective year courses as well as documentation of the
individual students extra-curricular and co-curricular activities. These details will hand over to the program coordinator in order to evaluate PO attainment of the individual student as well as individual course at the end of
the eighth semester. The Program coordinator has to evaluate the PO attainment of individual student through direct and indirect method after the student completing their program. All these works have to be done under
the guidance of Department Advisory Committee (DAC).

"The CO-PO mapping has been done with correlation levels of 3, 2, 1 and ‘-‘. The notation of 3, 2 and 1 denotes substantially (high), moderately (medium) and slightly (low). The meaning of ‘-‘ is no correlation between CO"
and PO.

Rubrics: The rubrics for various assessment processes are as follows;

Assessment for Theory subjects:

Internal Test:

Two mid examinations are conducted during a semester.

"• Each mid consists of Descriptive exam for 15 marks, Quiz for 10 Marks and Assignment for 5 Marks."
• Final marks for internal assessment was carried out as follows:

Final Internal Marks = (Best Mid Marks X 0.8 +other Mid marks X 0.2)

The questions in the internal examinations are mapped against COs of respective course. The questions for two internal examinations are framed in such a way to cover all course outcomes.
Two assignments are given for each course for continuous assessment. Average marks are considered.

End Semester Examinations (Theory):

End semester examinations are conducted by University.

"The external exam is for 70 marks, consists of 10 questions, two questions are from one unit and may contain sub questions also. Students can chose any question from each unit."

Assessment for Practical subjects:

"• The internal marks for practical subjects are 15 marks. Out of which 5 marks are for day-to-day work, 5 marks for record work and 5 marks for internal test."

Continuous evaluation is done by the faculty in every lab session for 5 marks and average of all lab session marks are considered as day-to-work and record marks.

Procedure for Attainment of Program Outcomes:
"At the end of the each programme, the PO/PSO assessment is done from the CO attainment of all curriculum components. As per NBA guidelines, program can appropriately define the attainment level. The attainment"
level may be set by the particular program or commonly by the institution. The attainment can be made as best the choice by the institution or the program by analyzing the students knowledge. This can be achieved by
"using different supporting activities. This attainment is mainly for the purpose of making an esteemed engineer with good analytical, practical and theoretical knowledge about the program by attaining the PSO’s of the"
"program and the institution. For the evaluation and assessment of CO’s and PO’s, rubrics are used."

3.3.1. B. The quality/relevance of assessment tools/processes used

Direct Assessment:

"Direct assessment of theory courses is carried out by Internal and External assessment of each defined outcome of a course. Internal assessment is done by Assignments, MID Examinations, Quiz Examinations and"
External Assessment by End Examination conducted by the JNTUK. The each PO attainment of corresponding to a particular course is determined from the attainment values obtained for each course outcome related to
"that PO and the CO-PO mapping values. Similarly, the values of PSO attainment are also determined."

Assessment for Theory subjects:

Internal Test:

Two mid examinations are conducted during a semester.

"• Each mid consists of Descriptive exam for 15 marks, Quiz for 10 Marks and Assignment for 5 Marks."
• Final marks for internal assessment was carried out as follows:

Final Internal Marks = (Best Mid Marks X 0.8 +Least Mid marks X 0.2)

End Semester Examinations (Theory):

End semester examinations are conducted by University.

"The external exam is for 70 marks, consists of 10 questions, two questions from each unit and may contain sub questions also. Students can choose any question from each unit."

Assessment for Practical subjects:

"• The internal marks for practical subjects are 15 marks. Out of which 5 marks are for day-to-day work, 5 marks for record work and 10 marks for internal test."
• Continuous evaluation is done by the faculty in every lab session for 5 marks and average of all lab session marks are considered as day-to-work and record marks.

"Faculty members of the ECE department adopt innovative teaching-learning practices in addition to conventional methods (chalk & board, sharing of materials, and questioning). These methods are designed to enhance"
"student engagement, improve comprehension, and bridge the gap between theory and practice."

A.The work must be made available on Institute Website

"Details of the teaching-learning methodologies followed by the department, along with academic resources, lesson plans, laboratory manuals, and innovative practices, are made available on the institute website https://"
"www.nriit.ac.in/. This ensures transparency, accessibility, and continuous engagement for students, faculty, and stakeholders."

B.The work must be available for peer review and critique

The Department of ECE encourages a feedback culture wherein both students and faculty peers are invited to share their constructive feedback on the teaching-learning methodologies adopted by the department. This
"feedback mechanism helps in evaluating the effectiveness of classroom delivery, identifying areas for improvement, and integrating innovative practices. By considering suggestions from students and faculty peers, the"
"department continuously enhances the quality of teaching, ensures better learning outcomes, and aligns its practices with the requirements of outcome-based education."

C. The work must be reproducible and developed further by other scholars

"The academic work of the Department of ECE, including course materials, lesson plans, laboratory manuals, and student projects, is systematically documented and preserved. These academic resources are made"
"available to enable other students and faculty members to reproduce the work, validate the learning outcomes, and build upon them for further academic development. Successive batches of students are encouraged to"
"extend earlier projects and assignments, thereby enhancing subject understanding and promoting continuity in learning. This practice ensures that academic contributions are not only reproducible but also serve as a"
foundation for advanced learning and knowledge enhancement.

"D. Statement of clear goals, use of appropriate methods, significance of results, effective presentation and reflective critique"

The department follows a systematic academic framework with clearly defined goals aligned to Program Outcomes (POs) and Course Outcomes (COs). Faculty members set measurable objectives at the beginning of each
"course, ensuring that appropriate teaching-learning methodologies are adopted."

"A mix of traditional (chalk & board, guided assignments) and innovative (Flipped classrooms, Project-based learning) methods are employed to achieve learning outcomes. The significance of these approaches is reflected"
"in enhanced student performance, problem-solving ability, and participation in academic projects and competitions."

Innovative Practices

"•   Project-Based Learning: Students undertake mini and major projects in Antenna Design, IoT, VLSI, Signal/Image Processing."
"•   Integration of NPTEL Courses: NPTEL Courses (DSP, VLSI, Optical Fiber Communication, Embedded Systems) aligned with curriculum."
"•   In-house Workshops for Skill Development: Workshops were conducted in VLSI, Embedded Systems, and related domains."
"•   Interactive Learning Tools: Use of Google Classrooms, Google Forms for quizzes, and online discussions."
•   Open Book Tests to improve critical and analytical skills.
•   Seminars & Presentations: Students present curriculum/advanced topics to build confidence and communication skills.
•   Industrial Visits to provide practical exposure and bridge industry–academia gap.
•   Simulation-Based Learning: Adoption of software tools for visualizing theoretical concepts.
•   Content Beyond Syllabus: Faculty deliver advanced topics to prepare students for higher studies and competitive exams.
•   Cultivate Soft Skills: Students are exposed to develop skills that go beyond textbooks.
"•   Use of LCD projectors, NPTEL videos for interactive teaching."

Framework for Implementation of Innovative Practices

1. Selection of Method - Program Assessment Committee (PAC) identifies suitable innovative methods aligned with COs/POs.

2. Implementation - Faculty integrate chosen methods in classrooms/labs.

3. Feedback Collection - Students and peer faculty provide feedback.

"4. Performance Evaluation - Monitoring student performance, participation, and learning outcomes."

5. Documentation & Reporting - Recording results for continuous improvement.

6. Diffusion of Best Practices - Sharing with other departments/institutions.

A. Well-defined Performance Appraisal and Development System

The institution has established a comprehensive and structured Faculty Performance Appraisal and Development System (FPADS) applicable to all faculty members for every academic year. The appraisal process is based
"on a transparent 100-point evaluation system, which assesses multiple dimensions of faculty performance including teaching–learning effectiveness, research output and publications, student mentoring and guidance,"
"administrative and extracurricular responsibilities, and contributions to overall institutional development. The FPADS not only evaluates past performance but also identifies areas for professional growth, thereby promoting"
continuous improvement. A copy of the performance appraisal form is attached for reference.

"The performance appraisal system is designed to evaluate faculty performance, identify strengths and areas for improvement, and provide constructive feedback. It helps in ensuring continuous professional development,"
"aligning faculty roles with institutional goals, and recognizing outstanding contributions. Faculty performance is assessed annually through a structured appraisal form, which is reviewed by the Head of the Institution, and"
"feedback is provided accordingly. Wherever improvement is required, faculty members are counselled through one-to-one interactions and encouraged to attend Faculty Development Programs (FDPs), workshops, and"
"other training sessions to enhance their technical knowledge, teaching methodologies, and professional skills. General issues and suggestions related to faculty performance are also discussed in departmental meetings,"
and collective action plans are framed for improvement.

"Based on the outcome of the appraisal, increments are awarded at the end of the academic year, training needs are identified, and corrective measures are taken to address any gaps in the system or policies. The"
"appraisal results are further used to ensure the right person is assigned to the right role, and necessary training programs are implemented where required. Faculty members are repositioned in their roles based on"
"performance, while good performers are appreciated and encouraged to excel further, and outstanding performers are recognized with rewards and awards. The appraisal system is reviewed annually by the Head of the"
"Institution, and feedback from faculty is incorporated to strengthen the process, ensuring fairness, transparency, and alignment with the objectives of the institution."

A. Assessment Shall be based on conduct and actions taken in relation to Continuous Improvement

(Academic Audit system/process and its implementation in relation to Continuous Improvement)

"The academic audit in the department is conducted by both internal and external audit experts. The Academic Audit Committee (AAC), Program Assessment Committee (PAC), and Department Advisory Committee"
"(DAC) carry out the internal academic audit. As per the proposed schedule, audits are conducted by these committees (AAC, PAC, and DAC), with members nominated by the Principal and the HoD before the"
commencement of each semester. The process of Academic audit is shown in the figure 7.2.1 below.




Figure 7.2.1: Process of Academic audit

"The internal audits are conducted by the AAC in coordination with the PAC. The AAC is chaired by a Professor or Head from another department, with two senior faculty members from the CSE department. In DAC"
"and PAC, Head of the Department acts as chairperson with other committee members supporting the audit process. The AAC, in collaboration with the PAC, monitors various academic parameters, prepares a report,"
"and submits it to the DAC. The DAC reviews these reports, prepares an assessment report with significant findings and recommendations, and forwards it to the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC)."

"External audits are conducted by experts from outside organizations, such as ISO and the Fact Finding Committee (FFC) from JNTUK. These external audit reports are submitted to the Principal. The IQAC reviews"
"both internal and external audit reports, prepares a report with recommended remedial measures, and forwards it to the department. The Head of the Department is responsible for implementing the actions"
recommended by the IQAC.

"Internal audits are conducted twice a year, at the beginning of each semester, while External audits are conducted annually."

Key Objectives

To ensure that academic standards are being maintained.

To evaluate the effectiveness of curriculum delivery and student performance.

"To identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in academic processes. To promote continuous improvement in teaching, learning, and assessment methods."

"To ensure alignment with Program Outcomes (POs), Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs), and Course Outcomes (COs)."

Focus areas of the Academic Audit Process

The academic audit typically focuses on the following key areas:

"Curriculum Review, POs, PSOs: Analyzing whether the curriculum aligns with industry standards, student needs, and academic goals, Course files, evaluating if COs are well-defined, measurable, and align with the"

• Regularity and Discipline:
"In the Student Mentoring System, academic and curricular performance is closely monitored through evaluation of both internal tests and semester-end examinations. Mentors track the results of Midterm (Mid-I, Mid-II) tests and semester-"
"end exams for each student, noting performance improvements or concerns. This data is recorded and used to guide students, recommend tutoring or remedial sessions if needed, and encourage high achievers for scholarship and recognition."
The mentoring process emphasizes continuous academic monitoring alongside attendance and behavioral checks to provide timely support for students’ overall development and success.
• Counseling Details:

The Student Mentoring System includes comprehensive counseling that addresses the following key issues:
1. Economic Issues:
"Counselors provide support to students facing financial difficulties, guiding them to scholarships, financial aid, and other resources to help them continue their education without undue financial stress."
2. Teenage Issues:
"Mentors help students navigate common adolescent challenges such as social media pressures, body image concerns, peer relationships, and emotional changes through guidance and appropriate counseling."
3. Health Issues:
"Students with health problems receive attention to ensure their well-being, including referrals to medical professionals if necessary, and accommodations to aid their academic progress."
4. Emotional Issues:
"Counseling services address emotional challenges like chronic discipline problems, temper issues, conflicts with authority, bullying behavior, and lack of empathy, providing support to improve emotional regulation and interpersonal"
skills.

"closely monitored to ensure learning objectives are met. External or Major Projects involve more extensive research and application, often incorporating real-world problems. Mentors guide students through planning, execution, and"
"presentation of these projects, documenting progress and outcomes. This record serves as an important aspect of the mentoring process to track academic growth, enhance hands-on experience, and prepare students for future professional"

9. Feedback analysis and reward /corrective measures taken (10)

"In NRIIT , a systematic methodology is used for the feedback on teaching-learning process. The process of feedback collection, analysis and evaluation in our institute is presented in Table 9.2.1."

"Table 9.2.1: Feedback collection, analysis and evaluation process"

Collection of feedback forms for all the subjects from the students based on
Step-1
parameters specified in the questionnaire.

Estimation of average for all the parameters and calculation of cumulative
Step-2
otherwise called threshold.

"After the recommendations of Principal, the threshold value will be finalized."
Step-3
The normal value setup at present is 3.5

"If the threshold exceeds 3.5, it will be considered as good. If it is less, the"
Step-4
faculty performance is considered as average or below average.

"If the faculty receives good performance, he will be rewarded with monitory"
benefits (additional increment). If he/she receives average or below-average
"performance, he/she gets counselling and allows them to get correct their"
Step-5          performances.

Faculty Performance Evaluation and Feedback Mechanism
1. Feedback Forms:

Standardized feedback forms are prepared to capture comprehensive evaluations of teaching and institutional parameters. These forms ensure uniformity in data collection and are designed to cover all relevant aspects that
impact quality education and faculty performance.

2. Principal’s Approval:

"The entire feedback process, including the content of feedback forms and schedules for their distribution and collection, is subject to the approval of the Principal. This oversight ensures that feedback mechanisms align with"
institutional goals and quality standards.

3. Feedback Collection:
"Feedback is collected through a dual-mode approach comprising both online and offline platforms. This method facilitates maximum participation from students and other stakeholders, providing flexibility and maintaining the"
confidentiality and integrity of the data collected.

4. Faculty members receive standardized feedback evaluated on a 5-point scale.

"5. If a faculty member’s overall feedback score is greater than 4.5, their performance is documented as good, and they may be recommended for rewards or recognition."

"6. If the score is between 3.5 and 4.5, the faculty member is required to undergo orientation classes to enhance teaching skills and address any weaknesses."

"7. If the score is less than or equal to 3, the faculty member may be subject to reassignment or replacement. Additionally, a formal memo will be issued requesting an explanation of their performance."

9.2.3. Corrective actions taken and its efficacy of the Feedback analysis:

"From the Figure 9.2.3, there is a gradual improvement in the teaching-learning process among all the programs for the last three academic years consistently with the methodology implemented for the analysis of"
feedback.

"In the process of feedback analysis to improve the teacher learning process, a unique process was developed. After the evaluation of feedbacks, faculty who received below 7 will be listed out for further evaluation either"
through a orientation class or recommended to attend FDPs etc. A record of corrective actions taken was maintained cumulatively for all the three batches. Through principal’s office a notification will be issued regarding the
orientations to be delivered for the improvement of teaching learning process. A committee will be constituted including Principal along with two program specific internal faculty members. The recommendations of the
"committee will be constituted and will given to faculty undergoing orientation will be given a specific time to improve his skills for a better teaching learning process. After the specified time, the faculty will be analysed against"
the feedback during his delivery in the same class and will be assessed based on the feedback taken again. Further improvements or guidelines will be forwarded to principal office accordingly. List of corrective actions taken
were detailed below in Table 9.2.3 for reference.

Process of Collecting feedback on Facilities from Parents:
The institution has established a formal policy for collecting and analyzing parent feedback to enhance the overall quality of education and facilities. Parents are invited to provide confidential feedback covering various aspects
"such as communication about their ward’s performance, satisfaction with teaching quality, student discipline, curriculum relevance, infrastructure, placement support, and extracurricular opportunities."

"All parent feedback is treated with confidentiality and used as a valuable resource to align institutional practices with stakeholder expectations, fostering a collaborative educational environment."

institute level is student centric and involvement of each and everyone in the decision-making at their respective levels is ensured through decentralization and delegation of powers. The principal is assisted by Academic
Council and IQAC in all the matters of interest and holds review meetings on monthly basis and decisions are collectively taken on the issues pertaining to improvement and functioning of the Institute. In-turn the Heads of the
"Departments conduct monthly faculty meetings within respective departments and obtain the details pertaining to academic and non-academic and any student related problems. Also, all the faculty members are student"
"counselors and they are in constant touch with the students through weekly meetings. The information collected by them is passed on to HODs who in turn appraise the HODs and the principal. Thus, the administration is"
transparent and trust-worthy and facilitates smooth conduct and function of the Institute. All purchases are handled by a Purchase committee who receive requisitions from various departments and the committee evaluates the
"need, timeframe of supply, budgetary provisions and accordingly processes the purchases requirements. The Committee is headed by Director and has senior faculties and administrators as members. The principal in turn"
briefs the management about the purchases to be made and all such proposals are finally put up in Governing Council meetings for approval.
