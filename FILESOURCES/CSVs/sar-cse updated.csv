Process for defining the Department Vision & Mission Formulation/Revision
"Department of Computer Science and Engineering defined its Vision and Mission by involving all the stakeholders. The stakeholders include parents, faculty, students, employers, industry experts, alumni etc"




The process for defining the Department Vision & Mission Formulation/Revision is as follows.
"Step 1: The process begins with the Institute Vision and Mission, which provide the foundation"
"Step 2: Based on this foundation, the HoD/Dean along with Faculty collaboratively draft the preliminary Department Vision and Mission in alignment with the institute. A Department Advisory Committee (DAC) is constituted to guide this formulation."
"\Step 3: Stakeholder inputs are then collected from: Internal: Faculty, Students, Management. External: Alumni, Parents, Industry Experts, Employers."
"Step 4: The draft is subjected to review by the DAC (industry & societal relevance) and by the PAC/BOS/IQAC (quality, policies, continuous improvement)."
"Step 5: The revised draft is forwarded to the Principal or Governing Body for final approval, ensuring compliance with institutional policies."
"Step 6: After approval, the Department Vision and Mission are finalized."
"Step 7: Finally, the Vision and Mission are published and disseminated to all stakeholders."



Process for defining the PEOs of the Program
"Department of Computer Science and Engineering defined its Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) by involving all the stakeholders. The stakeholders include parents, faculty, students, employers, industry, alumni etc."




The process for defining the Program Educational Objectives adopts the following sequence of steps.

"Step 1: HoD/Dean establishes a Department Advisory Committee (DAC) comprising eminent faculty, alumni, and industry leaders, to develop Program Educational Objectives that align with the Vision and Mission of Institute and Department"

Step 2: The HoD/Dean initiates the process of articulating the PEOs.

"Step 3: Stakeholder inputs are collected from: Internal: Faculty, Students, Management. External: Alumni, Parents, Industry Experts, Employers."

"Step 4: The faculty, under the guidance of the HoD/Dean, draft the initial PEOs based on the collected inputs."

Step 5: The draft PEOs are circulated among stakeholders for feedback.

Step 6: The draft is revised to incorporate relevant suggestions and improvements.

Step 7: The refined draft undergoes an approval process that includes: Review by the DAC for industry and societal relevance. Validation by the PAC/IQAC for quality and policy compliance. Final approval by the Board of Studies (BoS).

"Step 8: Once approved, the PEOs are finalized. Step 9: Finally, the approved PEOs are disseminated to all stakeholders."

"A part from the above the mentioned methodologies, few practices are under taken to instill interest among the students."

1. Think-Pair-Share

"In this interactive teaching strategy, students begin by reflecting on a question individually, then exchange their ideas with a partner, and ultimately present their insights to the whole class. This approach is intended to enhance student participation and deepen their understanding of the material. It"
involves three stages:

Methodologies to support Weak students and encourage Bright students

Guide lines to identify Weak and Bright students

"The Bright students are identified from their participation in classroom discussion, performance in the assessment tests and participation in classroom seminars, questioning ability and University result analysis. The process"




"The course coordinator, class coordinator and counselor generate the feedback related to identification of bright student sand weak students, however all the students are encouraged to participate in workshops/Internships/Coding tests and encouraged to register in NPTEL courses/higher studies."

"The Counselors regularly conduct meetings regarding progress of their mentees and are responsible for identification of students who haves cored less-than 60% Marks in their Mid-1exam. Under the HOD direction, the student’s Counselors evaluates the progress of the students who score below"
60% Marks in MID-1 examinations are considered as weak students and the same is also intimated to their parents.

Methodologies to guide weak students

"Remedial classes will be conducted for weak students fromi.e.,3:00PM to 5:00PM. At the end of these classes the students have to write the test and it will be evaluated and analyzed properly by course coordinator."

Separate Assignments are given to weak students and extra classes are conducted by course coordinators. Separate materials are provided to weak students.

"The course coordinator helps the students by teaching the essential concepts, giving assignments And conducting tests to improve the student’s score."

Weak students mentoring will be frequently done to identify the student socio economic problems and academic performance.

"Significant efforts are made to improve the academic performance of weak students through remedial classes/assignments. However, special trainings are conducted to get the campus placements for weak students."

•   Every student is provided with a computer on 1:1 ratio which ensures quality of laboratory experience.
•   Manuals are provided for all experiments in the laboratories before the commencement of the lab sessions.
•   The concept of the program to be coded and executed in the lab is thoroughly explained in the class duration and lab.
"•   Course coordinator monitors that every student is involved in writing the program, debugging the program and obtaining the correct outputs."
"•   Analysis and writing programs, executing and obtaining the results is done by students individually."
•   The obtained results are validated for all testcases.
•   First year students who are using the computer for the first time are supported to operate on the system until they are trained well to use the system.
•   There are few experiments included as content beyond the syllabus to meet the needs of the industry.
•   Few experiments are conducted in groups to implement collaborative learning that facilitates the individual to work in a team.
•   Viva-voce is conducted after each lab session.
"•   As part of this, different technical competitions like Quiz, Coding etc, are conducted to enrich the student’s knowledge and to create competitive spirit among them."

Continuous assessment in the Laboratory:

"For internal evaluation, total 25 marks are sub-categorized to 10marks for write-up and evaluation, 10 marks for continuous assessment and 5 marks for record work. Rubrics are used for the assessment of students in each Lab session"

"Rubric for day-to-day evaluation: The rubrics for day-to-day evaluation is designed based on student technical skills, interpersonal skills and regularity. The rubrics for lab session are designed to assess the student’s performance that is shown in Table 2.2.1.16."

Process for internal semester question paper setting and evaluation and effective process implementation

The process for internal semester question paper setting for Mid-I is shown in the following fig 2.2.2.1. The same process repeated for Mid-II. The process of Mid evaluation is depicted in the followingFig2.2.2.2.




Fig2.2.2.1: Process for internal semester question paper setting




Fig2.2.2.2: Process of Mid Examination Evaluation

•   Question paper for internal examination (Mid exam) is set in the standard format by the course coordinator for approximately 50%of the total syllabus for each mid exam.
"•   Under JNTUK regulations, the pattern of mid exam question paper consists of 3questions and the Student has to answer all the 3-Questions. Each question carries 5marks.This descriptive exam is conducted for 15 marks."
•   The department ensures that the course coordinator completes the syllabus required to conduct Exam by taking the course completion survey report twice in a semester.
•   Two sets of question paper will be prepared by the course coordinators.
•   The question paper contains questions from the syllabus with Cos coverage and the level of difficulty as per the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy action verbs. Scheme of evaluation will be prepared bythe corresponding course coordinator.
•   The quality of the question papers are evaluated by the PAC and verifies whether the question Paper is designed as per the Bloom’s Tax on my and covering the Cos and there port is submitted to Principal for further action or for improvement if required.
•   One set will be selected by the Principal one hour before on the day of exam.
•   The course coordinators prepares scheme of valuation for the mid exam question paper and evaluates the answer scripts as per the scheme.
•   The scheme of valuation and the valued answer scripts are shared with the students to maintain Transparency and affix their signature on the answer script after scrutiny.
•   The students are given a chance to ask doubts regarding the evaluation procedure or marks allotted The doubts are clarified by the course coordinator and the assessment is done
•   Mid marks will be displayed in the notice boards for students.
"•   Weak students will be identified and remedial classes are conducted to improve their learning ability through tests, assignments etc."

Process to ensure questions from out comes/learning levels perspective

•   The department ensures that the course coordinators strictly follow the learning levels while preparing the question paper for internal examination.
•   The course coordinator defines the Course Outcomes for the allotted course and maps the Cos to PO’s.
•   The Cos are written considering the contents in the syllabus and the ability of the student to learn after successful completion of the course.
•   The ever bused to describe the CO specifies the Blooms Tax on my level of understanding.
•   The course coordinator while preparing the questions for internal examination ensures that the questions framed are also mapped to the same level as defined by Cos and is clearly indicated in the question paper

Quality of Assignments and its relevance to Cos

•   Assignments are given to students from the topics covered in each unit and satisfying the Cos defined
"•   The questions framed in the assignments are taken from multiple sources (previous question papers, text books, etc.) and cover not only the theoretical conceptual so impart creativity on real time applications"
•   Six Assignments covering each unit are given in each course for every semester
•   Every Assignment carries 5marks and an average of 3assignments for 5marks is considered for mid exam
•   The assignments are evaluated within two weeks after submission and the valued assignments are returned to the students for their security and improvement Mapping is done for all questions of the assignment with the COs of the course
•   The quality of the assignment questions are also audited by PAC.

Quality of Student Projects

Identification of Projects and Allocation Methodology to Faculty Members

"The Project Review Committee (PRC)members will initiate the process of Guide allocation for student’s projects, before the commencement of semester. They will conduct meeting with faculty members and will identify potential implementation areas of projects. During this meeting, they pin point key"
"areas of focus, incorporating the latest Machine Learning, Deep Learning and IoT, etc. Problem statements with in these domains are then formulated, by allowing students to select projects based on their personal interests. The detailed process of student’s project is shown in Fig 2.2.3.1."




Fig2.2.3.1: The detailed process followed for Student’s Project

Batch Formation

"The students are divided into Project batches by first ranking the students based on their performance in examinations (CGPA/average SGPA/number of backlogs) up to III year II semester/III Year I Semester For example, for 15batches, the top 15 students are nominated as team leaders for the"
"respective batches. The 16 ranker is allotted to the 15 batch, 17 ranker to the 14 batch and soon with the 30 ranker to The 31 ranker is then allotted to the 1batch and the cycle is repeated. The following Fig 2.2.3.2 is a project registration form of 2023-24 academic year."

Guide Allocation Methodology:

"The selection of students for projects is based on their knowledge, methodology, skillset, and interest in the project topic based on student domain interest from each project team. The team will consist of a maximum off our (in rare case five students) and faculty members will be assigned as guides"
to support the students. The faculty member’s area of interest should align with the interested project domain of the students. The project batches list a long with guide allocation is provided to the students. The PRC is responsible for the guide allocation. The project guide allocation form is shown
below in Fig 2.2.3.3.

Project Evaluation

"The project work is designed to challenge and show case the student’s innovative and analytical abilities, allowing them to integrate and apply knowledge from various disciplines. Evaluation of the project will occur at the end of the fourth year, with a total of 200 Marks allocated. Of these, 60 Marks"
are designated for Internal Evaluation and 140 Marks for External Evaluation.

"Internal Evaluation is monitored by PRC. Similarly, for External Evaluation, external examiner will be designated by the affiliated University (JNTUK)."

• The project review involves assessing individual student’s power-point presentations on their completed work and their plan of action for the remaining tasks.

"·The assessment considers factors such as environment, safety, ethics, cost, applicable standards, teamwork, and alignment with CO-PO/PSO mapping."

"·Suggestions provided by the panel or other faculty members must be incorporated by the students, and these will be reviewed in subsequent reviews."

·The evaluation format and power-point presentations are used to assess both individual and team performance.

·Rubrics for project work assessment have been incorporated.

Process to assess Individual and team Performance

"All projects are evaluated both on a batch-wise and individual basis. The grading rubric is provided with the problem statement, and evidence of group participation is incorporated into the grading procedure. To achieve the highest marks, continuous assessment by the project guide is"
maintained.

Evaluation Criteria:

Continuous Assessment:

• Daily Reviews: The project guide conducts daily reviews to assess the progress of the group and the interaction among students. This helps in obtaining a qualitative measure of group and individual performance.
"• Literature Survey and Presentation: Weightage is given to the literature survey and presentations, evaluated both at the batch level and for individual contributions."

Quantitative Measures:

Attendance: Regular attendance is considered in the evaluation

Group Evaluation: Group performance is assessed to gauge collective effort and outcomes

Initiatives Related to Industry Interaction

"An Engineering student should be technically and globally competent to acquire the opportunities and should also meet the industrial needs. To meet these objectives, itis necessary to provide industry exposure and a platform to adapt the technological changes. The department frequently takes"
necessary measures to fulfill the goals.

The implementation details for industry interaction are listed as below:

•   Initiate tasks by inviting the industrial members for valuable seminar and guest lectures.
•   Invite professional HR sand conducted an interaction session’s personally.
•   Encourage the students for industrial visits & training programs.
"•   Interaction with different esteemed industrial experts like EFFECTRONICS, BRAINO VISION, IVIS, ORACLE ACADEMY, L4G SOLUTIONS and etc"
•   Conduct training sessions by industrial experts on latest technologies.
•   Collect feedback from experts for progressive conduction of events.
•   Feedback assessments are noted from students for further improvements.

Industry Supported Laboratories

"• With the advent of globalization and opening up of Indian economy to outside world, competition among industries has become stiff. Similarly, there is an emerging need to prepare engineering students for jobs in multinational companies, by exposing them to newer technologies and"
engineering methodologies.
• These objectives can only be achieved well by bridging the gap between industry and the academic institutions. Better interaction between technical institutions and industry is the need of the hour. This will have great impact on the exposure of engineering students to industry and
subsequent placements of young graduating engineers in industries across the country.
• Internet of Things (IOT) lab is established in the department in association with INNOVATIVE Technologies and multiple projects are developed in this lab. The department is having MOUs with multiple industries and the industry-institute collaboration that helps in improving student’s
technical skills.

3.2.1 Describe the assessment processes used to gather the data upon which the evaluation of Course Outcome is based (10)

"(Examples of data collection processes may include, but are not limited to, specific exam/tutorial questions, assignments, laboratory tests, project evaluation, student portfolios (A portfolio is a collection of artifacts that demonstrate skills, personal characteristics and accomplishments created by the"
"student during study period), internally developed assessment exams, project presentations, oral exams etc.)"

"NRI Institute of Technology, affiliated to JNTUK, follows the R20 Regulation for students admitted in the academic years 2020-21, 2021-22, 2022-23,2023-24 respectively. The assessment tools for evaluating Course Outcomes in the B.Tech program under these regulations include midterm"
"examinations, assignments, online quizzes, project work, seminars, laboratory internal examinations, day-to-day lab course evaluations, and end-semester examinations for both theory and laboratory courses."

"Course outcomes are statements that specify what a learner will know or be able to do as a result of a learning activity. Outcomes are usually expressed as knowledge, skills, or attitudes. It is a measurable, observable, and specific statement that clearly indicates what a student should know and"
"be able to do as a result of learning. It describes what students are able to demonstrate in terms of knowledge, skills and values upon completion of a course/a span of several courses. Program Outcomes (Pos) describe what a program is expected to accomplish. Pos describe what students"
should know and be able to do at the end of the programme. Pos are to be in line with the graduate attributes as specified in the NBA. Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) are statements that describe what the graduates of a specific engineering program should be able to do. Clear articulation of
"course outcomes, Pos and PSOs serves as the foundation for evaluating the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process. Course correlation matrix shows the learning relationship (Level of Learning Achieved) between Course Outcomes and Program Outcomes of a course. This matrix"
strongly indicates whether the students are able to achieve the course objectives/outcomes.




The matrix can be used for any course and is a good way to evaluate a course syllabus/content/structure.


"To evaluate the attainment of COs, the following are considered:"
1. Performance of students in the Internal Examinations.
2. Performance of students in the Semester End Examinations.



Direct assessment tools: Internal Examinations and External Examinations.

Indirect assessment tool: Course End Survey.


Theory Courses:
"• Under the R20 Regulation, theory courses are evaluated with 30 marks allocated for internal assessments and 70 marks for the end-semester examinations. During the semester, two midterm exams are conducted."
"• The internal marks, totalling 30, are distributed as follows: 15 marks for descriptive exams, 5 marks for assignments (which may involve theory, design, analysis, simulation, algorithms, or drawing, depending on the course), and 10 marks for an online quiz. The online quiz is conducted at the"
"college level and consists of 20 multiple-choice questions, each carrying a weightage of 0.5 marks."



"• The online quiz test for 20 minutes, while the subjective exam is 90 minutes long. The subjective exam includes 3 questions, all of which must be answered."
"• The syllabus is divided into 5 units. The first midterm exam (both online quiz and subjective) covers units 1 2, and the first half of the 3. The second midterm exam covers the second half of unit3 and ` 4 ,5 ."
"• The end-semester examination, conducted by JNTUK, covers the entire syllabus and is worth 70 marks. It consists of 10 questions (two from each unit, with an internal choice), and students must answer five out of these 10 questions with each question carrying 14 marks"


Laboratory Courses:
"• For laboratory courses, continuous evaluation during the semester accounts for 15 internal marks, while the end-semester examination is worth 35marks."
"• The internal marks are awarded as follows: 5 marks for day-to-day evaluation, 5 marks for maintaining a lab record, and 5 marks based on an internal laboratory exam."
• The end-semester lab examination is conducted by the concerned faculty along with an external examiner appointed by JNTUK.


Project Work:
"• The project work is evaluated out of a total of 200 marks, with 60 marks allotted for internal evaluation and 140 marks for the end-semester examination. The end-semester examination, which includes a viva-voice, is conducted by a committee comprising an external examiner appointed by"
"JNTUK, the Head of the Department, and the project supervisor."
"• The internal evaluation is based on three project reviews presented by each student, which are assessed by an internal committee. The project evaluation takes place at the end of the fourth year."


Internship:
"The internship, evaluated for a total of 50 marks, is designated by APSHE (Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education). The evaluation is based on several components, including the internship report, where students document their experiences in detail, and a presentation summarizing"
"their work, challenges faced, and the outcomes achieved. Feedback from the industry supervisor, who assesses the student’s performance and professionalism during the internship, is also considered. The evaluation is conducted by a committee comprising an internal faculty supervisor, who"
"oversees the student’s progress and evaluates the report and presentation, and an external evaluator appointed by JNTUK, who ensures that the assessment aligns with university standards."




Indirect Attainment:
"At the end of every semester, a course end survey is taken for every course from which indirect attainment is calculated."

3.2.2 Record the attainment of Course Outcomes of all courses with respect to set attainment levels (40)

Attainment Calculation:

The overall attainment of course outcomes is determined through a combination of direct and indirect assessments.

Direct Attainment involves evaluating marks obtained from various assessments:

"• Internal Marks: These include marks from midterm exams (descriptive, quizzes, and assignments), laboratory assessments (day-to-day performance, internal marks, and records), seminars, and projects."
• External Marks: These are derived from end-semester examinations.

"For each course, 4 to 6 survey questions are designed to gather student feedback in a course-end survey, which constitutes the Indirect Attainment."

"The weightage of each Course Outcome (CO) is calculated based on the marks obtained in descriptive exams, one-third of the online quiz marks, and one-third of the assignment marks."

"Direct Attainment Calculation: A target value is set for internal and end-semester examination attainment. The internal examination target is 30%, while the end-semester examination target is 70%. These target values are converted into percentages to measure the course’s achievement."


Attainment Level:
LEVEL 1: >=40 - <50% Marks



LEVEL 2: <=50 - <70% Marks



LEVEL 3: >=70% Marks

The attainment of Program Outcomes (PO) is assessed through two key components: Direct Attainment and
Indirect Attainment.
1. Direct Attainment: This involves calculating the attainment based on the marks students achieve in
"all courses, providing a quantitative measure of their academic performance."
"2. Indirect Attainment: This is assessed by gathering feedback from stakeholders, such as students,"
"alumni, and employers, regarding the effectiveness of the program outcomes, as illustrated in Fig.3.3.1"

The direct attainment of Program Outcomes (PO) is determined by aggregating the attainment levels of all courses using the following assessment process:

"1. Course-PO Mapping: Course-PO mapping tables, as shown in Table 3.1.3, are collected from the respective course coordinators for all courses."
"2. Course Attainment Values: Course attainment values, as detailed in Table 3.2.1, are gathered from the respective course coordinators."
3. Calculation of Course-PO Attainment: The Course-PO attainment is calculated using the formula:


"4. Direct PO Attainment: The average of these course-specific attainment values is then computed for each individual PO, resulting in the overall direct PO attainment."

4. Reproductivity of the Work

"To ensure the credibility and reliability of the educational practices implemented, it is crucial that the work is reproducible. This involves providing detailed and transparent documentation of all methodologies, procedures, and materials used in the Blended Learning and the peer review process."
"Additionally, feedback collected has been systematically recorded and analyzed to offer constructive insights and recommendations. By adhering to these practices, high standard of educational quality is maintained and ensured that the processes and outcomes can be reliably reproduced by"
other educators and researchers. This approach not only validates the effectiveness of intra institute teaching learning methods but also contributes to the broader educational community by providing a model that can be adapted and implemented in similar contexts
"Their insights help evaluate the innovative methods from a wider institutional perspective, ensuring they are effective and aligned with the institution’s broader academic goals and standards."

"The performance appraisal system is designed to evaluate faculty performance, identify strengths and areas for improvement, and provide constructive feedback. It helps in ensuring continuous professional development, aligning faculty roles with institutional goals, and recognizing outstanding"
"contributions. Faculty performance is assessed annually through a structured appraisal form, which is reviewed by the Head of the Institution, and feedback is provided accordingly. Wherever improvement is required, faculty members are counselled through one-to-one interactions and encouraged to"
"attend Faculty Development Programs (FDPs), workshops, and other training sessions to enhance their technical knowledge, teaching methodologies, and professional skills. General issues and suggestions related to faculty performance are also discussed in departmental meetings, and collective"
action plans are framed for improvement.

"Based on the outcome of the appraisal, increments are awarded at the end of the academic year, training needs are identified, and corrective measures are taken to address any gaps in the system or policies. The appraisal results are further used to ensure the right person is assigned to the right"
"role, and necessary training programs are implemented where required. Faculty members are repositioned in their roles based on performance, while good performers are appreciated and encouraged to excel further, and outstanding performers are recognized with rewards and awards. The"
"appraisal system is reviewed annually by the Head of the Institution, and feedback from faculty is incorporated to strengthen the process, ensuring fairness, transparency, and alignment with the objectives of the institution."

It was an engaging experience! Mr. Gautam Sunandans visit to our campus on World

"be a game-changer for aspiring entrepreneurs, especially engineering students looking to turn"
their ideas into reality.

wonderful that he was able to share his knowledge and experience with them.

"NRI Institute of Technology believe in decentralization of activities and delegation of authorities is the key concept in the success achieved by the institute on different platforms. Basically, overall working methodology at institute level is student centric and involvement of each and everyone in the"
decision-making at their respective levels is ensured through decentralization and delegation of powers. The principal is assisted by Academic Council and IQAC in all the matters of interest and holds review meetings on monthly basis and decisions are collectively taken on the issues pertaining to
"improvement and functioning of the Institute. In-turn the Heads of the Departments conduct monthly faculty meetings within respective departments and obtain the details pertaining to academic and non-academic and any student related problems. Also, all the faculty members are student counselors"
"and they are in constant touch with the students through weekly meetings. The information collected by them is passed on to HODs who in turn appraise the HODs and the principal. Thus, the administration is transparent and trust-worthy and facilitates smooth conduct and function of the Institute. All"
"purchases are handled by a Purchase committee who receive requisitions from various departments and the committee evaluates the need, timeframe of supply, budgetary provisions and accordingly processes the purchases requirements. The Committee is headed by Director and has senior faculties"
and administrators as members. The principal in turn briefs the management about the purchases to be made and all such proposals are finally put up in Governing Council meetings for approval.
