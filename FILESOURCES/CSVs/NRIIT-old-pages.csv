Debating is carried out in debating chambers and assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by voting. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leader's debates, are sometimes held in democracies. Debating is also carried out for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies."

"Summary Report Debate:"
"Debate is a process that involves formal discussion on a particular topic. In a debate, opposing arguments are put forward to argue for opposing viewpoints. Debate occurs in public meetings, academic institutions, and legislative assemblies. It is a formal type of discussion, often with a moderator and an audience, in addition to the debate participants."
"Logical consistency, factual accuracy and some degree of emotional appeal to the audience are elements in debating, where one side often prevails over the other party by presenting a superior ""context"" or framework of the issue. In a formal debating contest, there are rules for participants to discuss and decide on differences, within a framework defining how they will do it. Debating is carried out in debating chambers and assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by voting. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leader's debates, are sometimes held in democracies. Debating is also carried out for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies."

"ABOUT"
"ABOUT US"
"DEPARTMENT:MATHEMATICS"
"Engineering mathematics is the art of applying maths to complex real-world problems; combining mathematical theory, practical engineering and scientific computing to address today's technological challenges."
"Technical skills"
"All Engineering Mathematics degrees are built on five key themes which cover theoretical and practical aspects of the application of mathematics. They run throughout the programmer, developing technical skills in each area as you progress, reaching the frontiers of current research in the fourth year of our MEng degrees"
"Mathematical modelling"
"The flagship theme of the Engineering Mathematics degree. You'll apply all the skills from the rest of the programme to solve real world problems, working individually or in groups. The case study problems are up-to-the-minute, span a huge range of discipline areas, and are derived from current research, industry and business."
"Mathematics"
"Core mathematics is an inherent part of our degree programmes, and the type of mathematics you'll study is incredibly varied. First year mathematics units bridge the gap between school and university mathematics. By your final year, many units are motivated by our research interests and will take you to the frontiers of the subject. You'll learn a unique blend of continuous and discrete mathematics, enabling you to understand the underlying structure of an extraordinarily wide range of applications."
"Scientific computing"
"Computing is crucial for applying mathematics in the real-world. Unlike in text books, many problems at the cutting edge of science and engineering do not result in equations with nice analytical solutions. So you'll use computers to find approximate numerical solutions. We'll teach you the programming skills needed to complement your other technical skills."
"Engineering"
"You'll gain an excellent background in general engineering so that you can really engage with practical problems, as well as learning the language of engineering. You'll have the chance to experience courses across the Faculty, including dynamics and control, thermodynamics, fluids, space systems, cryptography and sustainability."
"Data science and machine learning"
"Being able to analyse big data is nowadays a fundamental skill. We will provide you with strong statistical foundations and specialistic knowledge of the most effective machine learning techniques to address the challenges of data analysis across scales and applications."

Debate
All the year Students

"Summary Report Debate:"
"Debate is a process that involves formal discussion on a particular topic. In a debate, opposing arguments are put forward to argue for opposing viewpoints. Debate occurs in public meetings, academic institutions, and legislative assemblies. It is a formal type of discussion, often with a moderator and an audience, in addition to the debate participants."
"Logical consistency, factual accuracy and some degree of emotional appeal to the audience are elements in debating, where one side often prevails over the other party by presenting a superior ""context"" or framework of the issue. In a formal debating contest, there are rules for participants to discuss and decide on differences, within a framework defining how they will do it. Debating is carried out in debating chambers and assemblies of various types to discuss matters and to make resolutions about action to be taken, often by voting. Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts engage in debates. In particular, in parliamentary democracies a legislature debates and decides on new laws. Formal debates between candidates for elected office, such as the leader's debates, are sometimes held in democracies. Debating is also carried out for educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies."

"The institute attracts the cream of student community from across the country through national level competitive examinations and interviews. It believes that the true potential of such students cannot be realized through academics alone. The students are provided with opportunities for exploring and enhancing their talents in extra- curricular activities through Literary, Cultural and Sports clubs. This helps to promote self- management skills and core values in the students, all of which cumulatively help to groom the students into integrated personalities."
"The students are involved in a host of other activities. All major events like youth festivals; technical competitions are actively organized and conducted by the student body. There is student representation on various administrative committees like Hostel Governing Body, Canteen Committee, Course Monitoring, Discipline Committee etc. All Student committees function under the peripheral supervision of faculty. Students thus get an opportunity to shoulder responsibility and understand better the issues, challenges and compulsions that are part and parcel of the day-to-day administration of an organization, which indirectly provides for rich experiential learning in the Science of Management."
